Project Title: Predicting Loan Default Risk with Logistic Regression
Brief Description
This project focuses on building a predictive model to assess the risk of loan default using logistic regression. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively distinguish between healthy loans and high-risk loans. The project involves several key steps, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Key Steps and Components
Data Loading and Exploration:

The project begins with loading and exploring the dataset, which contains information about loan applications, including features such as credit score, loan amount, and employment status.
Data Preprocessing:

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the data for model training.
Model Development:

The logistic regression model is chosen as the predictive model due to its suitability for binary classification tasks. The model is trained on the original dataset and then retrained using oversampled data to address class imbalance.
Model Evaluation:

The performance of the logistic regression model is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and balanced accuracy. The evaluation is conducted on both the original and oversampled datasets to compare the model's performance.
Results Analysis:

The project concludes with an analysis of the results, highlighting how well the model predicts healthy loans and high-risk loans. The impact of oversampling on model performance is discussed.
Project Structure
The project is structured into different components, including data handling, model training, and evaluation.
